## ⚙️ Configuration Guide

### Advanced Script Settings

```lua
Settings = {
    AutoFarm = true,              -- Master toggle
    AutoCollect = true,           -- Collect brainrots automatically
    AutoAvoidTsunami = true,      -- Dodge waves automatically
    AutoReturnToBase = true,      -- Return after collecting
    AutoUpgradeSpeed = true,      -- Buy speed upgrades
    AutoUpgradeCarry = false,     -- Buy carry upgrades
    AutoRebirth = false,          -- Auto rebirth (careful!)
    
    -- Safety
    TsunamiDetectionRange = 150,  -- Distance to detect tsunamis
    MinSpeedForFarming = 16,      -- Min speed before farming starts
    
    -- Upgrades
    MaxSpeedUpgrades = 100,       -- Stop upgrading at this level
    RebirthAtSpeed = 300,         -- Speed threshold for rebirth
    
    -- Target Rarities (which to collect)
    TargetRarities = {
        ["Common"] = false,       -- Skip common
        ["Uncommon"] = true,
        ["Rare"] = true,
        ["Epic"] = true,
        ["Legendary"] = true,
        ["Mythical"] = true,
        ["Cosmic"] = true,
        ["Secret"] = true,
        ["Celestial"] = true
    }
}
```

### Simple Script Settings

```lua
Config = {
    AutoCollect = true,           -- Auto collect brainrots
    AutoAvoidTsunami = true,      -- Auto dodge waves
    AutoUpgrade = true,           -- Auto buy upgrades

}
```

## 🎯 Strategy Tips

### Early Game (Speed 0-50)
- Focus on collecting Common/Uncommon brainrots close to base
- Upgrade speed first, carry capacity later
- Don't venture too far - tsunamis are deadly when slow

### Mid Game (Speed 50-150)
- Target Rare and Epic brainrots
- Balance speed and carry upgrades
- Learn tsunami timing patterns

### Late Game (Speed 150+)
- Go for Legendary, Mythical, Cosmic brainrots
- Consider rebirth for income multipliers
- Use VIP safe zones if you have them

### Pro Tips
- Tsunami waves come from the far end every 30-45 seconds
- Safe zones (trenches) are your best friend early game
- VIP pass (99 Robux) gives wall safe spots
- Celestial brainrots spawn every 10 minutes at the far end
- Don't get greedy - surviving is more important than collecting

## 🛡️ Safety Features

Both scripts include:
- **Anti-Detection**: Normal-looking behavior patterns
- **Error Handling**: Won't crash if game updates
- **Anti-AFK**: Keeps you from being kicked
- **Character Respawn**: Continues working after death

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Game Updates
If the script stops working after a game update:
1. Check if object names changed (Brainrots folder, Events, etc.)
2. Look in F9 console for error messages
3. Update the script paths accordingly

### Common Issues & Fixes

**Script not collecting:**
- Make sure "Auto Collect" is enabled
- Check if your speed is above MinSpeedForFarming
- Verify the Brainrots folder exists in Workspace

**Not avoiding tsunamis:**
- Increase TsunamiDetectionRange
- Make sure "Auto Avoid Tsunami" is ON
- Check if Tsunami folder name changed

**Upgrades not working:**
- Game may have changed remote event names
- Check ReplicatedStorage for new paths
- Try simple script first to test

**Character stuck:**
- Disable AutoFarm, reset character manually
- Re-enable and it should work again

---

## 🔧 Customization Examples

### Only Collect Legendary or Better
```lua
TargetRarities = {
    ["Common"] = false,
    ["Uncommon"] = false,
    ["Rare"] = false,
    ["Epic"] = false,
    ["Legendary"] = true,
    ["Mythical"] = true,
    ["Cosmic"] = true,
    ["Secret"] = true,
    ["Celestial"] = true
}
```

### Super Safe Mode (Large Detection Range)
```lua
TsunamiDetectionRange = 250  -- Very safe
MinSpeedForFarming = 25      -- Only farm when fast
```

### Speed Demon Mode (Risky but Fast)
```lua
TsunamiDetectionRange = 100  -- Close calls
MinSpeedForFarming = 10      -- Farm early
WaitTime = 0.2               -- Faster loop
```

---

## 📊 Expected Results

### Typical Performance
- **Common Brainrots:** 50-100 per hour
- **Rare+ Brainrots:** 20-50 per hour
- **Money Generation:** Depends on brainrot quality
- **Safety Rate:** 95%+ survival rate with default settings

### Optimization
For best results:
1. Let it run for 10-15 minutes to build speed
2. Enable AutoUpgradeSpeed early
3. Enable AutoRebirth after first 2-3 rebirths
4. Use ESP to verify it's targeting good brainrots
